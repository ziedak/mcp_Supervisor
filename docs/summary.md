# MCP Supervisor – Project Summary

A robust, production-grade Model Context Protocol (MCP) Supervisor for context/resource/tool management, built with strict TypeScript, Bun, and modern best practices.

## Project Summary

- **Purpose:**
  - Provides a type-safe, extensible, and observable supervisor for managing workspace context, resources, and actionable tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
  - Designed for integration with AI agents, developer tools, and advanced automation systems.

- **Key Features:**
  - **TypeScript (strict mode):** All code is strictly typed for safety and maintainability.
  - **SOLID Architecture:** Modular, composable, and dependency-injected core and adapters.
  - **MCP Adapters:**
    - Exposes all workspace resources (info, audit log, config, rule results, plugin info, user/task context, etc.)
    - All tools and resources are actionable, filterable, and return real data.
    - Zod schemas for type safety and validation.
  - **Comprehensive Error Handling:** All endpoints and services have robust error handling and logging.
  - **Testing:**
    - Jest (with ts-jest) for all unit and integration tests.
    - High coverage for MCP adapters, core services, and utilities.
    - Mocks and real implementations for DI and transport integration.
  - **Development Tooling:**
    - Bun for package management and scripts
    - ESLint (TypeScript rules) and Prettier for code quality
    - Strict commit, naming, and formatting conventions

- **Project Structure:**
  - `src/` — Source code (adapters, core, config, utils)
  - `tests/` — Jest-based tests (unit, integration, mocks)
  - `cli/`, `docs/`, etc. — Supporting files

- **Scripts:**
  - `bun run dev` — Development mode (watch)
  - `bun run build` — Production build
  - `bun run test` — Run all tests
  - `bun run lint` — Lint code
  - `bun run format` — Format code

- **Status:**
  - All MCP resource and tool endpoints are present, type-safe, and tested.
  - Core test setup issues resolved (esp. AuditLogService).
  - Remaining work: fix DI/transport integration test failures, further increase coverage.
